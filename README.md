The name of this organization is Point.

* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The founders are experienced in the Tech space and have all founded other start up companies; The inspiration for this business came out through each founders personal experience within the mortgage lending industry as either consumers attempting to obtain financing or as friends of consumers looking to them as a resource for securing a home with limited personal funds.

The company is funded by VC’s (Series A: 2015- $9.1M, Series B: 2019- $42M, and Series C: 2022- $120M)


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Lets detail the table shaking innovation of Point- But first a short history lesson. We need to set some foundational knowledge about the mortgage space.

Traditional mortgages (purchase money, rate and term refinance, and home equity loans/lines of credit) are based on the “4 C’s”. 

Capacity: Your financial ability to repay the mortgage loan based on the ratio of your income to your debts; This facilitated by the potential borrower submitting income and/or employment documentation for lenders to evaluate.

Credit: Your history of repaying your debts to other creditors according to the agreement (original terms. This is evaluated by pulling what is called a “tri-merge” credit report. 

Capital: This is the cash the borrower has on hand (liquid) or available to them with some effort (non-liquid); A traditional purchase money mortgage will require some capital (cash/investment) from the potential borrower in order to secure financing. 

Collateral: (this is critical to Points business plan) This is the real estate that secures the financing. Traditionally the home is used as collateral in the event the loan is not repaid. The amount of financing you can get is in relation to the value of the property and this is evaluated by an appraisal. An Appraiser inspects your home (in a multitude of ways) and provides lenders with an opinion of the value.

If you have made it this far you can understand the problem with the 4 C’s of evaluating and securing mortgage financing can be a daunting task. 

In comes Point 
Points’ business model is that your home is an investment, actually - THE investment. Point evaluates your home (Collateral), makes a value determination, via appraisal in most cases. 15-20% of that value is the HEI (home equity investment) and is loaned to you with Point acting as a marketplace for investors who want to buy “shares” of your property value; 

This is a major game changer: You are not contractually obligated to make any payments at all for up to 30 years. Point is essentially purchasing a steak in your property’s appreciation (not your home, just the increase in value). When it’s time, or you opt to repay your loan, Point utilizes or generates another valuation, and the repayment amount is a percentage of the current value (if its increased) plus the original loan. The loan is contingent primarily on the property, with some decision influence based on your credit profile, according to Point credit scores as low as the 500’s. This business model can be immensely more inclusive then the traditional mortgage industry if applied with this intent as a core value.

With this innovation Point has side stepped the traditional mortgage space which can be time consuming, expensive, exclusive, and inherently biased to the end user (the borrower) and have potentially made it inclusive, quick, cheap, and more convenient.



* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Points intended customer is anyone who is in the market for a down payment assistance, home equity line of credit, or any other financing need that can be solved by tapping into the value of their home- who also may not be in the position to make monthly payments, or have the credit score or credit profile to secure a traditional mortgage. After reviewing the Equity Sharing space, their intended customer may not be the most appropriate customer, it appears that their appropriate customer should be consumers in need of a bridge loan.


What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Point has similar loan parameters and fees, with Points fees being on the higher side, and customer rating being on the lower side. Point does not have a discernible edge on its direct competitors but has an edge on traditional lenders.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Points main technology is an algorithm(s), that allows them to estimate the appreciation of homes over the course of 30 years.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 
Points financial industry domain is mortgage lending;

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 

Major trends in mortgage lending have been information based technology when it comes to property information, automated valuations, paperless environment platforms, platforms for TPV (3rd party verifications of income, assets, tax documentation);

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Points competitors are Hometap, Unlock, and Unison.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 

As described earlier, the major impact to the industry is another lending option and/or product that may be more inclusive or otherwise beneficial to the consumer. Where a door closes, Point may be an open window.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Per Points LinkedIn post from last month, they have officially funded $1 billion in home equity investments (loans). This is major for the organization because according to reviews some contracts were approved but not funded due Points lack of capital at that time; 



* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would not suggest any additional services or products for this company, I would suggest they provide more transparency toward the property types and values they can secure HEI’s on. I also recommend reviewing their internal controls and algorithms to ensure they are actually more inclusive and the algo’s don’t also have built in biases. My final recommendation would be to evaluate the downgrade in value at the start of the contract, when there is not such risk adjustment at the final valuation. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I believe doing these checks will act as a guide to inclusivity and establish them as a reputable company and not a predatory lender;
